Today is Halloween, an ole Irish holiday, let’s celebrate by eating candy.
We will explore some data all about Halloween candy from the 538 website.

**1. Importing Candy Data**
```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.txt"
candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```
>Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

```{r}
rownames(candy)
```
>Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
candy$fruity
```
```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```
```{r}
sum(candy$chocolate)
```

**2. What is your favorite candy?**
```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```
> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

Class Favorite Mentions:

```{r}
candy["Skittles original","winpercent"]
```

My favorite candy:
```{r}
candy["100 Grand","winpercent"]
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat","winpercent"]
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars","winpercent"]
```
Another way:
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
candy |>
filter(rownames(candy)== "Haribo Happy Cola") |>
select(winpercent)
```
Class Question: Find furity candy with a winpercent above 50%?

```{r}
candy |>
filter(winpercent>50) |>
filter(fruity==1)
```

OR this way . . .

```{r}
top.candy <- candy[candy$winpercent > 50,][candy$fruity==1,]
top.candy[top.candy$fruity == 1,]
```

To get a quick insight into a new dataset some folks like using the skimr package and its skim() function

```{r}
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q.6  Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, it looks like the winpercent variable/column is measures on a different scale to the majority
of the other columns in the datasets.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

The zeros and one represent True or False statements on if the candy is chocolate or not. If
it’s classified as chocolate then its a 1 and if its classified as fruity or not chocolate then 0.

> Q.8 Plot a histogram of winpercent values

We can do this in a few ways. e.g. the “base” R hist() function or with ggplot()

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, breaks=10)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
aes(winpercent) +
geom_histogram(binwidth = 8) +
theme_bw()
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No, the distribution of winprecent values is not symmetrical. The distribution appears skewed
right.

>Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```
The center of the distribution is around at 50%, since the mean is 50.32.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
fruit.candy <- candy |>
filter(fruity==1)
summary(fruit.candy$winpercent)
```

```{r}
summary(candy[as.logical(candy$chocolate),]$winpercent)
```
Chocolate candy appears to be higher ranked than fruit candy.

>Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(candy$chocolate, fruit.candy$pricepercent)
```

No, this difference is not significantly different because the p-value of this t-test is not below
0.05% to be significant.

**3 Overall Candy Rankings**

>Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in
this set?

Use sort and order function:
```{r}
play <- c("d","a","c")
sort(play)
```

```{r}
order(play)
```
```{r}
play[order(play)]
```

```{r}
head(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], 5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
sort(c(2,5,10), decreasing = T)
```

```{r}
tail(candy[order(candy$winpercent),], 5)
```
> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
geom_col()
```

ADD color
```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
aes(x=winpercent,
y=reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),
fill=chocolate) +
geom_col()
```

But. . . I want more custom color scheme where I can see both chocolate and bar and fruity
etc. all from the one plot. To do this we can roll our own color vector

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

or...

```{r}
#Place holder color vector:
mycols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
mycols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] <- "chocolate"
mycols[as.logical(candy$bar)] <- "brown"
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "pink"
#Use blue for your favorite candy:
mycols[rownames(candy)=="100 Grand"] <- "blue"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
aes(x=winpercent,
y=reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent),
fill=chocolate) +
geom_col(fill=mycols)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst ranked candy is Sixlets.

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked candy is Starburst.

**4. Taking a look at pricepercent**

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
geom_point(col=my_cols) +
geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 29)
```

With the class: Plot of winpercent vs pricepercent to see what would be the best candy to buy

```{r}
mycols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <- "darkgreen"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
aes(winpercent, pricepercent) +
geom_point(col=mycols)
```

Add labels
```{r}
ggplot(candy)+
aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) +
geom_point(col=mycols) +
geom_text(col=mycols)
```

Make the labels non-overlapping
```{r}
library(ggrepel)
ggplot(candy) +
aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
geom_point(col=my_cols) +
geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 29)
```
> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

By looking at the graph, chocolate is the highest candy type in terms for the least money. The
candy with the best winpercent for the least amount of money would be Reeses minitures.

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```
**5 Exploring the correlation structure**

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```
> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
(i.e. have minus values)?

Fruit and chocolate are anti-correlated.

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Bar chocolate and chocolate are most positively correlated.

**6. Principal Component Analysis**

```{r}
pca <-prcomp(candy, scale=T)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=mycols, pch=16)
```

How do the original variables (columns) contribute to the new PCs. I will look at the PC1 here.

```{r}
loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
ggplot(loadings) +
aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1), fill=PC1) +
geom_col()
```
Making nicer plot with ggplot():

```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) +
aes(x=PC1, y=PC2,
size=winpercent/100,
text=rownames(my_data),
label=rownames(my_data)) +
geom_point(col=my_cols)
p
```
```{r}
library(ggrepel)
p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 49) +
theme(legend.position = "none") +
labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
caption="Data from 538")
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
```
```{r}
ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```
> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Fruity, pluribus, and hard variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction. Yes, this does make sense to me.
